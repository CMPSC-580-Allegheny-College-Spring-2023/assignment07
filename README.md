# Junior Seminar (CS580) Assignment 07

Experiment: Answering a Research Question using a Prototype

**Assigned** : Tuesday 21th March 2023

**Due** : Tuesday 4th April 2023

## Objectives

* To design some essential and foundational _object_ (i.e., or tool, code, etc.) of the research project. This object is called the __prototype__.

* To conduct an experiment using the developed prototype to collect preliminary data with a goal of answering at least one significant research question connected to the research project idea

* To determine some of the parameters which are necessary to complete a technical project. 

* To explore the available resources at hand (i.e., tools, skills, literature, data, and etc.) which will be applied to the completing of the project.

__Figure 1__: Building a significant part (a prototype) of a project will take time, but will allow you to run early experiments to determine preliminary results to add support for your proposal. In addition, the prototype that you build will also showcase your ability to be able to complete the project that you will propose.

## Introduction

At this point in your project's evolution, you will want to have a working and well-documented prototype to run experiments, provide data, allow for feedback, analyze results, and /or showcase some important foundational theory of your work.

Additionally, you should have a well-defined research project accompanied by several important research questions that can be proven or disproven by using the prototype to address some form of research hypotheses, expectations about how a certain critical phenomena, or is able to address some significant and foundational part of your work. Note, if you are building theory, or constructing a website to inform, for example, then your prototype might take the form of a concrete and complete part of this effort that has its own value.

This prototype will also add support to your original idea since you can use the prototype to highlight and showcase parts of your thinking and project design. 

### Experiments

In the scientific process, an _experiment_ typically refers to a process that tests a hypothesis, but it can also try to answer "what if" questions without the need for expectations about what the results might look like, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment).

__Over the next part of this project development process, you will design and carry out an experiment (using the prototype) that will test your research hypothesis and will attempt to answer at least one important research question connected to your research idea.__

* __Experiment Design__: You need to begin by planning your experiment. Experiment’s output is data so you can begin by thinking about anticipated findings (what research questions might you be able to answer) and decide what data you need to produce to get to those findings. Then, you can design your prototype for the experiment with desired output data in mind. 

  + For more information about the design of experiment, see, "What experimental findings will answer my research question?" (ref: “Plan the Experiment” in Chapter 6, p. 92, of the Published textbook, [1]). 

  + Please note, you can identify the steps of the experiment, that is, "What are you going to do, and exactly how will you do it?" It is helpful to conceptualize your experimental design by writing down your ideas, making a flow diagram of the workflow of the experimental steps, and discussing them with a colleague.

* __Running the Experiment__: Now that you have carefully thought through your experiments and identified all of the steps necessary to complete it, you can finally begin your experiment (ref: “Run the Experiment” in Chapter 7, p. 104, of the Published textbook, [1]). As you run your experiment, remember to take notes, document your progress, and monitor your experiment consistently to be able to catch any mistakes early on. In particular, check the preliminary data that you are collecting to observe that it looks as expected. It is likely you will have to troubleshoot errors as you go through this process and it is common for a researcher to redo the experiment, sometimes multiple times!

Explore, but do not wander when completing your experimentation: Exploration implies preparation where-as wandering implies no clear destination (ref: chapter 7, page 5 of the _Published_ textbook, [1]).

* __Analyzing Results__: Once you can confirm that your findings are meaningful to your project, and are accurate, you have successfully completed an experiment. 

   + In order to do this, you will need to consider analyzing output data (for example, running some statistical analysis on your output data) and visualizing its findings (ref: “Visualize the Findings” in Chapter 8, p. 124, of the Published textbook, [1]). 
   + You will need to choose the right type of visualizations (in your work, website, or project documentation) to display your findings to help illustrate the points your are trying to achieve.

### Overview of Tasks

* THIS week’s work

  + __Part1__; For __Tuesday__: Design an experiment. Respond to questions in File `writing/reflections.md`.
    - Identify what research question related to your research project you will attempt to answer with an experiment.
    - Identify what experimental findings that will answer your research question. What data will your experiment produce?
    - Outline the detailed steps of your experiment. To help visualize these steps create a technical diagram of your experimental steps 
(workflow of what you will do in your experiment).

  + __Part2__; For class __Thursday__: Peer review your experimental plan. Respond to questions in File `writing/reflections.md`. Begin class by pairing with a colleague and walking each other through your experimental design. Ask each other the following types of questions:

    - What data are you trying to produce?
    - How can your experiment generate that data?
    - How can your prototype run that experiment?
    - What additional functionality or input does your prototype need to run the experiment?
    - How can this additional functionality or input be created?

  + Then, document your review of your colleague’s experimental design in a GitHub issue in your colleague’s “prototype” repository (i.e., this assignment's repository) by commenting on the following prompts.

    - Well-defined research question.
    - Experiment that can attempt to answer the research question above.
    - Clear output data to be derived from an experiment.
    - Implemented prototype can clearly facilitate in running the experiment. 
    - Detailed steps outlining the workflow of the experiment.

  + __Part3__: For end of class and beginning of lab  __Thursday__. Begin building the prototype. Write code or construct the concrete and foundational part of your work.
    + Work on ensuring that your prototype is fully ready to run your experiment and, if any input information/data is needed that it is available for the experiment.
    + Any code related should be clearly labeled, documented, and located in your "prototype" repository. Please also be sure to describe how to use the code.

* NEXT week’s work

  + __Part 4__; For class __Tuesday__: Finish building prototype. Run the experiments. Respond to questions in File `writing/reflections.md`. 
    - Now you need to run your experiment using your prototype. Be sure to carefully follow the steps you identified in your experimental design, document your progress, and check your results frequently.

    - All additional implementation you complete for the experiment must be put in your repository and must be clearly labeled and documented. Also, all of the output data produced by the experiment must be put into a clearly labeled directory in this "prototype" repository.

  + __Part 5__; For class __Thursday__: Continue running and tweaking experiments, and collecting, analyzing, and visualizing the results. Respond to questions in File `writing/reflections.md`.

    - During this lab you are to complete your experiment, and collect, analyze, and visualize results. Please research methods of displaying the results of your data analysis or deliverable output using preferably visual aids. Please refer to “Visualize the Findings” chapter in the Published textbook [1] to learn of the techniques of producing effective visualizations.

  + __Part 6__; For Lab __Thursday__: Lightening talk: discuss experiments and demonstrate prototype. Discuss prototype performance and outcomes of running experiments.

    + Lightening talk. Prepare a three min presentation / demonstration of your experiment and its results.
    + Please be ready to discuss how this experiment is relevant to the research ideas which are at being studied in your project and how it attempts to answer at least one of your research questions.

#### Extra Notes

* __Software resources__ Your prototype that you create for this work is to be documented and submitted along with your other deliverables for this work. In your documentation, please be sure to discuss how to use (run, view, etc.) the prototype.

* __Web notebook__: Please provide a cohesive blog post to summarize your experiment and its results on your website (min 200 words). Please title your posting, __Experiment__.

## Project Assessment

The grade that a student receives on this assignment will have the following components.

- **GitHub Actions CI Build Status [up to 10%]:**: For the repository associated with this assignment students will receive a checkmark grade if their last before-the-deadline build passes. This is only checking some baseline writing and commit requirements as well as correct running of the program. An additional reduction will given if the commit log shows a cluster of commits at the end clearly used just to pass this requirement. An addition reduction will also be given if there is no commit during lab work times. All other requirements are evaluated manually.

- **Mastery of Technical Writing [up to 60%]:**: Students will also receive a checkmark grade when the responses to the writing questions presented in the `reflection.md` reveal a proficiency of both writing skills and technical knowledge. To receive a checkmark grade, the submitted writing should have correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation in addition to following the rules of Markdown and providing conceptually and technically accurate answers.

- **Presentation [up to 30%]:**
Students will receive a checkmark grade for presentations. Student must be present to receive credit for presentation.
